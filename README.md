# LOS-Fisher-MIP
Julia Implementation of a Mixed-Integer Program with constraints that ensure agents respect obstacles, maintain a connected network, and produce viable paths with the objective of maximizing the Fisher Information Matrix based on the estimated position of a ground target. Built upon prior work, which can be found at https://github.com/nilloch/LOS-Network-MIP.

Created by Collin Hudson as a final project for ASEN 6519 "Cooperative Information Gathering" Spring 2025
